# Architecture & Design Plugin

**Comprehensive architecture and design patterns with SOLID principles, Clean Code standards, and TypeScript best practices for building maintainable applications.**

## Overview

This plugin provides expert guidance on software architecture, design patterns, and code quality standards. It ensures code follows industry best practices and maintains high quality throughout the development lifecycle.

Each skill is **highly specialized** following the **Single Responsibility Principle** to avoid duplication and conflicts.

## Skills

### 1. Project Standards

**Name**: `project-standards`

**Purpose**: Project-specific standards and critical rules for the Bun + TypeScript stack.

**When to Use**:

- Starting any development task
- Before committing code
- When asking about project workflow or tech stack
- Setting up new features or modules

**Key Areas**:

- Critical rules (barrel files, testing commands, type safety, git workflow)
- Tech stack (Bun, Hono, Drizzle, React 19, Vite 6, TanStack Router)
- Bun runtime specifics
- MCP server usage (Context7 and Perplexity)
- Pre-commit checklist
- Commit message conventions
- Quality gates workflow
- Security requirements

- Code reviews
- Detecting over-engineering
- Balancing abstraction vs simplicity

**Key Areas**:

- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - Simplicity over complexity
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - Build only what's needed now
- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) - Apply after Rule of Three
- **TDA** (Tell, Don't Ask) - Encapsulation and command methods
- Function design (small functions, meaningful names, single level of abstraction)
- Code organization (early returns, avoiding deep nesting)
- Common anti-patterns (premature optimization, clever code, magic numbers)

### 3. SOLID Principles

**Name**: `solid-principles`

**Purpose**: SOLID principles and clean architecture patterns.

**When to Use**:

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** - Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** - Subtypes must be substitutable
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** - Small, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** - Depend on abstractions
- When to apply (and when NOT to over-apply)
- Common anti-patterns to avoid

### 4. Clean Architecture

- **Application Layer** - Use Cases, DTOs, Ports (interfaces)
- **Infrastructure Layer** - Adapters (repositories, external services)
- **Presentation Layer** - Controllers, routes, HTTP/CLI handling
- Repository pattern and Dependency Injection
- Testing strategy (pure unit tests for domain, mocked tests for application)
- Anti-patterns to avoid (anemic domain model, fat controllers)

## Critical Rules Summary

**NEVER:**

- Use `any` type â†’ Use `unknown` with type guards
- Use `bun test` â†’ Use `bun run test`
- Commit without tests and type-check
- Commit directly to `main` or `dev`
- Return null for errors â†’ Throw exceptions or return `undefined`
- Over-engineer simple solutions

**ALWAYS:**

- Run `bun run craft` after creating/moving files
- Create feature branches from `dev`
- Apply SOLID principles appropriately
- Follow naming conventions
- Handle errors with context
- Write type-safe code
- Keep code simple (KISS)
- Build only what's needed (YAGNI)

## Quality Standards

The plugin enforces:

1. **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid (avoid over-engineering)
2. **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It (build only what's needed)
3. **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself (Rule of Three)
4. **TDA**: Tell, Don't Ask (proper encapsulation)
5. **SOLID**: All five principles applied appropriately
6. **Type Safety**: No `any`, always use proper types
7. **Error Handling**: Exceptions with context, Result pattern for expected failures

## Common Patterns

### Value Object with Branded Type

```typescript
type Email = string & { readonly brand: unique symbol };

export function createEmail(value: string): Email {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  if (!emailRegex.test(value)) {
    throw new ValidationError("Invalid email format", { email: value });
  }
  return value as Email;
}
```

### Repository Pattern with Dependency Inversion

```typescript
export interface UserRepository {
  save(user: User): Promise<void>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<User | undefined>;
}

export class PostgresUserRepository implements UserRepository {
  async save(user: User): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### Use Case with Error Handling

```typescript
export class CreateUserUseCase {
  constructor(
    private userRepository: UserRepository,
    private passwordHasher: PasswordHasher
  ) {}

  async execute(dto: CreateUserDto): Promise<User> {
    // Validate
    if (!this.isValidEmail(dto.email)) {
      throw new ValidationError("Invalid email", { email: dto.email });
    }

    // Business logic
    const hashedPassword = await this.passwordHasher.hash(dto.password);
    const user = new User(dto, hashedPassword);

    // Save
    try {
      await this.userRepository.save(user);
      return user;
    } catch (error) {
      throw new DatabaseError("Failed to save user", error);
    }
  }
}
```

### Result Pattern for Expected Failures

```typescript
type Result<T, E = Error> =
  | { success: true; value: T }
  | { success: false; error: E };

async function findUser(id: string): Promise<Result<User, NotFoundError>> {
  const user = await repository.findById(id);

  if (!user) {
    return { success: false, error: new NotFoundError("User not found") };
  }

  return { success: true, value: user };
}
```
