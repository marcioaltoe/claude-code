## Check PR Review Status

This command displays a summary of the current status of issues for a Pull Request review.

## Usage

```bash
# View summary file for a PR
cat .reviews/reviews-pr-<pr>/summary.md

# Count unresolved issues
find .reviews/reviews-pr-<pr>/issues -name "*_unresolved.md" | wc -l

# Count resolved issues
find .reviews/reviews-pr-<pr>/issues -name "*_resolved.md" | wc -l

# List unresolved critical issues
ls .reviews/reviews-pr-<pr>/issues/*_critical_unresolved.md

# List unresolved major issues
ls .reviews/reviews-pr-<pr>/issues/*_major_unresolved.md

# List unresolved trivial issues
ls .reviews/reviews-pr-<pr>/issues/*_trivial_unresolved.md
