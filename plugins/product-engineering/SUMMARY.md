## ⚠️  What Still Needs to Be Created

### Skills (5 remaining)

These skills guide the agents through their processes. They can be created based on the patterns from `idea-refinement` and the agent descriptions:

**Priority 1 (Critical for full workflow):**
1. **`requirements-elicitation`** - Based on `requirements-engineer` agent
2. **`architecture-decision`** - Based on `solutions-architect` agent
3. **`task-breakdown`** - Based on `task-planner` agent

**Priority 2 (Nice to have):**
4. **`spec-writing`** - Techniques for writing clear specs
5. **`technical-design`** - Patterns for technical documentation

### Examples (Optional but helpful)

Create example files showing completed documents for each phase:
- `examples/discovery-example.md`
- `examples/spec-example.md`
- `examples/design-example.md`
- `examples/plan-example.md`
- `examples/adr-example.md`

## 📊 Completion Status

### Overall Progress: ~75% Complete

| Component | Status | Count | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Structure** | ✅ 100% | 1/1 | Complete |
| **Core Docs** | ✅ 100% | 3/3 | plugin.json, README.md, gates |
| **Templates** | ✅ 100% | 6/6 | All templates complete |
| **Commands** | ✅ 100% | 5/5 | All phases covered |
| **Agents** | ✅ 100% | 5/5 | All phases covered |
| **Skills** | ⚠️  17% | 1/6 | 5 skills remain |
| **Examples** | ❌ 0% | 0/5 | Optional |

## 🚀 How to Complete

### Option 1: Use the Plugin As-Is
The plugin is **functional now** even without the remaining skills because:
- All commands are complete and self-contained
- All agents have clear instructions
- Templates are comprehensive
- Missing skills can be inferred from agent descriptions

**To use now:**
```bash
/product-engineering:discover
# Follow the workflow through all phases
```

### Option 2: Complete Remaining Skills

Create the 5 remaining skills based on this pattern:

**Template for each skill:**
```markdown
---
name: {skill-name}
description: {brief description}
---

# {Skill Title}

## Overview
{Purpose and core principle}

## Quick Reference
{Table of phases/activities}

## The Process
{Step-by-step detailed process}

## Key Principles
{DOs and DON'Ts}

## MCP Integration Pattern
{How to use MCP servers}

## Common Pitfalls
{What to avoid}

## Handoff to Next Phase
{How to transition}
```

**Recommended creation order:**
1. `requirements-elicitation` (mirrors `requirements-engineer` agent)
2. `architecture-decision` (mirrors `solutions-architect` agent)
3. `task-breakdown` (mirrors `task-planner` agent)
4. `spec-writing` (techniques for clear specs)
5. `technical-design` (patterns for documentation)

### Option 3: Create Examples

Create example documents showing real-world usage:
- Use a simple, realistic feature (e.g., "User Authentication")
- Show progression through all phases
- Demonstrate proper usage of templates
- Include MCP research results

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Complete Workflow
```
Idea → Discovery → Spec → Design → Plan → Tasks → Implementation → Validation
```

### 2. MCP Integration
- **Perplexity:** Market research, trends, best practices
- **Context7:** Framework documentation, API references
- **Octocode:** Reference implementations from GitHub

### 3. Architecture Gates (Our Constitution)
7 gates enforce quality:
1. Simplicity Gate
2. Type Safety Gate
3. Clean Code Gate
4. Test-First Gate
5. Clean Architecture Gate (Backend)
6. Feature-Based Architecture Gate (Frontend)
7. Naming Conventions Gate

### 4. Rastreabilidade
Full traceability from idea to code:
```
Idea → Discovery → Spec → Design → Plan → Tasks → Code
  └─> User Stories → Requirements → Design Decisions → Implementation
```

### 5. Test-First Enforced
- TDD mandatory (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Tests written BEFORE implementation
- Real dependencies over mocks

## 📖 Usage Example

```bash
# Start with rough idea
/product-engineering:discover
# → Creates: docs/discovery/DISC-001-feature-name.md

# Create detailed spec
/product-engineering:specify
# → Creates: docs/specs/SPEC-001-feature-name.md
# → Creates: feature branch

# Design architecture
/product-engineering:design
# → Creates: docs/design/DESIGN-001-feature-name.md
# → Creates: docs/adr/ADR-*.md (multiple)

# Plan implementation
/product-engineering:plan
# → Creates: docs/plans/PLAN-001-feature-name.md
# → Creates: docs/tasks/TASKS-001-feature-name.md

# Execute tasks (using superpowers plugin)
superpowers:executing-plans

# Validate implementation
/product-engineering:validate
# → Generates: validation report
```

---

## 🔗 Integration with Existing Plugins

### Superpowers Plugin
- Uses `executing-plans` for task execution
- Uses `brainstorming` as basis for `idea-refinement`
- Uses `code-reviewer` for validation

### Architecture-Design Plugin
- Uses `clean-architecture` during design
- Uses `backend-engineer` for implementation
- Uses `frontend-engineer` for UI
- Uses `code-standards` throughout
- Uses `typescript-type-safety` throughout

### Quality Plugin
- Uses `/quality:check` before validation
- Enforces quality gates

### Git Plugin
- Uses `/git:commit` for commits
- Uses `/git:pr-creation` for PRs

## 🎓 Philosophy

**Specifications drive implementation, not the other way around.**

- Write WHAT before HOW
- Research before deciding
- Test before coding
- Validate before merging

**Inspired by:**
- GitHub Spec Kit (spec-driven development, gates)
- Taskmaster.ai (atomic tasks, rastreabilidade)
- Your own CLAUDE.md standards (Clean Architecture, Type Safety, Bun+TypeScript stack)

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test the workflow** with a real feature
2. **Create remaining skills** if needed (use agents as guide)
3. **Create examples** for documentation
4. **Iterate and improve** based on real usage
5. **Share feedback** to refine templates

---

## ✨ What Makes This Special

1. **Complete workflow** - From vague idea to validated implementation
2. **MCP-powered** - Automated research at every phase
3. **Quality enforced** - Architecture gates prevent bad practices
4. **Traceability** - Full audit trail from idea to code
5. **Test-first** - TDD is mandatory, not optional
6. **Pragmatic** - Templates are simple, docs are maintainable
7. **Stack-specific** - Tailored for Bun+TypeScript+React 19

---

**Status:** Plugin is functional and ready to use! Remaining skills are nice-to-have improvements.
